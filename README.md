# cyFile

## Introduction

cyFile is an open-source project spun off from another open-source project called “[Cangyan](https://github.com/Goolnn/cangyan),” written in the Rust programming language. This crate is designed to efficiently handle archive files (with the `.cy` extension) generated by the Cangyan application. Cangyan is a tool developed to simplify the work of translation teams in translation, retouching, and image typesetting tasks. By integrating commonly used features for translation workflows, it improves efficiency and reduces communication costs between different groups within the team.

While enhancing the functionality of the project, cyFile also emphasizes user-friendliness, ensuring that users can easily adapt to and incorporate it into their workflows without encountering significant learning curves.
